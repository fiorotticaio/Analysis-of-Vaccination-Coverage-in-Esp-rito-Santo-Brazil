# Analysis of Vaccination Coverage in Espírito Santo, Brazil

## Introduction

This project investigates the decline in vaccination coverage against exanthematous diseases in different regions of Espírito Santo, Brazil, between 2021 and 2023, with a focus on the MMR (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella) vaccine. The reduction in vaccination rates has contributed to a growing number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, especially from Measles and Rubella, representing a setback in Brazil's previous achievements in immunization. These diseases are viral, highly contagious, and frequently encountered in medical practice, particularly among the pediatric population, posing significant public health challenges.

## Objectives

The main objective is to analyze the reduction in vaccination coverage for vaccine-preventable exanthematous diseases, focusing on Measles and Rubella, in Espírito Santo. The analysis will consider age groups and regional profiles, and will relate the decline in coverage to the increase in the number of cases of these diseases.

## Methodology

This is a retrospective, quantitative, and descriptive study, to be conducted between the second half of 2024 and the first half of 2025. Data collection will be performed using the following sources:
- Vacina e Confia database
- Espírito Santo State Health Department (SESA)
- DATASUS

The study will cover cases from 2021 to 2023. The analysis will include the distribution of exanthematous disease cases and corresponding vaccination coverage, considering variations by age group and regional profile.
